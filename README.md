# Learning-Win32
I'm learning the WinAPI. This is just code for my documentation of my learning progress

I've been told by friends not to bother learning the WinAPI. However, I've come across too much code in my study on game development.
It just seems like something I can't/shouldn't ignore. Let me know if you read this and you think I am misguided in any way. 
A lot of people preach about cross-platform coding, but I'm not sure how to learn the in's and out's of cross-platform coding
if I don't first learn about the platforms themselves and what makes them so unique from one-another.
